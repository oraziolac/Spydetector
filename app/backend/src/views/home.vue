            <p>Spydetector is a forked and enhanced version of TinyCheck, Spydetector's main objective is to detect signs of compromise by monitoring network flows transmitted by a device.</p>
            <p>As it uses WiFi, Spydetector can be used against a wide range of devices, such as smartphones, laptops, IOTs or workstations. To do its job, the analysis engine of Spydetector is using Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), anomaly detection and is supported by Suricata. </p>

            <p>This backend lets you configure your Spydetector instance. You can push some IOCs for detection and whitelist elements which can be seen during legit communications in order to prevent false positives.</p>
